            <ul>
              <li>2-3 large eggs</li>
              <li>Salt, to taste</li>
              <li>Pepper, to taste</li>
              <li>1 tablespoon of butter or oil</li>
              <li>
                Optional fillings: cheese, diced vegetables, cooked meats, herbs
              </li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          Instructions Beat the eggs: In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of
          salt and pepper until they are well mixed. You can add a tablespoon of
          water or milk for a fluffier texture. Heat the pan: Place a non-stick
          frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil. Cook the omelette:
          Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan
          to ensure the eggs evenly coat the surface. Add fillings (optional):
          When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly runny
          in the middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the
          omelette. Fold and serve: As the omelette continues to cook, carefully
          lift one edge and fold it over the fillings. Let it cook for another
          minute, then slide it onto a plate. Enjoy: Serve hot, with additional
          salt and pepper if needed. Nutrition The table below shows nutritional
          values per serving without the additional fillings. Calories 277kcal
